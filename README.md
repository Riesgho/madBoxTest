# Test Senior - Game Tool Dev

## The time it took you to perform the exercise
* The exercise took me around 8 hours, most of the time coding but some time reading about Editor Tools.

## The parts that were difficult for you and why
* The hardest parts were the ones related to Editor, just because, as I told you folks on the previous interviews is not my greates expertise area. But I really liked learning it and doing it and I am looking forward do work more with this.

## The parts you think you could do better and how
* First of all the joystick, is a sensitive part that requieres a lot of love:

    * Add dead zone
    * Add more speed up regarding the distance from the center of the first touch.
    * Add UI that follow the direction of the drag.

* Second part is Testing, I usually do this projects using TDD, but is an investment for bigger projects, so wanted to focus on the productive code.
* Third, I would really like to improve the Unity Inspector tools layouts to make easier to navigate and make the changes.
* Fourth Improve the logic of the targetting, for now is just one raycast, could be a better structure with a multiple raycasting detection or a custom collider.
* Also if the game growth more the initialization should be cleaned up and separate it follwing a similar architecture as the one proposed with the folders.

## What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

Well, there are a lot of things to do, implement mob logic, reaction for the player when hit, loot for the weapons would be fun. The game feels like the first step on an 3d Adventure game, so I would take it there.


## Any comment you may have

As I mentioned to Romain, I really enjoyed doing this, from creating the architecture which is one a feel really confident that can grow easily with the game features, to making the Editor tools, which is something I always wanted to do and it was incredible fun to interect with the game in that way.
